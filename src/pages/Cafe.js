              We use our own carefully curated blend roasted by Darkwoods
              coffee, West Yorkshire. We only use specialty graded coffee, which
              has a cleaner and more distinctive flavour than cheaper commercial
              coffee, and is traceable back to the skilled farmers that produce
              it.
