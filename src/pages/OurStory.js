          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>
            Bragazzi’s opened in Sheffield in 2003, owned by Matteo Bragazzi.
            Bragazzi’s was (perhaps is) an outlier and safe haven for people who
            like dry ham and little cups of coffee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Matteo has a brother, Dino. They often holiday together and were in
            Rome one year when Matteo drifted into a melancholy state of mind.
            Sorry to see him this way, Dino started up a monologue on a history
            of Italian dining in London. Their dad had come over, like so many
            others, and made a business of food selling. As Dino reached a point
            about napkins, Matteo recognised his fate as the same.

            He interrupted mid sentence and asked for five hundred euros. They
            did a big shop of crisps and pasta and floated it to England, ready
            for the cafe to come.
          </p>
          <h4>What we do</h4>
          <p>
            Bragazzi’s is a cafe, delicatessen and shop. We sell Italian
            perishables and dry goods, all of which are good to eat. Most people
            come for the sandwiches, which are potent assemblies of D.O.C
            cheese, salami and preserved vegetables.
          </p>
          <p>
            At breakfast, we have pastries. In summer we have gelato. In winter,
            we have shelves of hard-to-find Christmas produce direct from
            producers in Italy.
          </p>
          <h4>Services</h4>
          <p>
            Bragazzi’s cater for all functions. All of our food is made in-house
            and shaped around what you need for your event.
