            We use our own carefully curated blend roasted by Darkwoods coffee,
            West Yorkshire. We only use specialty graded coffee, which has a
            cleaner and more distinctive flavour than cheaper commercial coffee,
            and is traceable back to the skilled farmers that produce it.
