              We trade directly with suppliers in Italy. We choose to work with
              suppliers who focus on the quality, integrity and provenance of
              their produce. Year round we sell a wide range of everyday staple
              foods.
            </p>
            <p>
              We maintain a good supply of everyday items such as flour, dried
              pasta shapes, chocolates, and sauces, and our deli counter is
              always well stocked with DOP cheeses and cured meats. Youâ€™ll find
              fresh Italian eggs for making the most beautiful fresh pasta, and
              fresh Italian sausage to stir through it.

              We are a small team of people, with different interests and
              experiences, but with a common appreciation for the somewhat
              overlooked, and at times undervalued occupation of shopkeeping,
              and the unrelenting pursuit of making good coffee.
